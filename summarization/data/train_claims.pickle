p33618
sV17817_1_11
p33619
V-LRB- 9 -RRB- In Israel 's view , Hamas ' behavior and its reliance on terror tactics will never change if it thinks it can attack with impunity , and so the Israeli military operations were necessary and justified in the name of restoring Israel 's deterrent and weakening Hamas , both of which make long term peace more likely .
p33620
sV17817_1_8
